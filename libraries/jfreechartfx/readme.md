Key features of **JFreeChart** include:

- multiple chart types: pie charts, bar charts (regular and stacked), line charts, area charts, scatter plots and more;
- mouse-enabled chart viewing components (for both JavaFX and Swing) provide interactivity (mouse event support on all chart elements) and zooming options, plus configurable tool-tips;
- flexible data sources (the charts are coded to dataset interfaces not implementations);
- regular and logarithmic axes;
- auto-adaptive axis labeling;
- value and range markers for all numerical axes;
- item labelling;
- support for PDF, SVG, PNG and JPEG export of charts for reporting;
- a clean and well-documented API with a high degree of chart configurability.
